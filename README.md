crossfire
=========

A basic framework for creating a simple, multi-platform browser extension.  Supported browsers include: Safari, Chrome, Firefox

How to use
=========
Build all extensions with: python bin/build.py

Right now it's only compiling the directories for each extension, and not building actual packages.  

You can easily install it in Chrome by going to your Extenions page, clicking on "Load unpacked extension", then pointing to the 'chrome' directory under 'builds'.
